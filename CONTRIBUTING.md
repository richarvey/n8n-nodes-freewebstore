## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or higher)
* npm (v7 or higher)
* n8n installed (locally or via Docker)
* A FreeWebStore account with API access for testing

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n8n-nodes-freewebstore.git
   cd n8n-nodes-freewebstore
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Link to your n8n installation:
   ```bash
   npm link
   cd ~/.n8n
   npm link n8n-nodes-freewebstore
   ```

6. Start n8n in development mode:
   ```bash
   n8n start
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Use 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
* Use single quotes for strings
* Use camelCase for variable and function names
* Use PascalCase for class and interface names
* Add JSDoc comments for public functions
* Keep functions small and focused

### Node Development Guidelines

1. **Follow n8n conventions**: Study existing n8n nodes for patterns and best practices
2. **Error handling**: Always provide clear error messages
3. **Type safety**: Use TypeScript types for all parameters
4. **Testing**: Test all operations with real API calls
5. **Documentation**: Update README.md with any new features

### Example Code Style

```typescript
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		displayName: 'Example Node',
		name: 'exampleNode',
		group: ['transform'],
		version: 1,
		description: 'Description of what this node does',
		defaults: {
			name: 'Example Node',
		},
		inputs: ['main'],
		outputs: ['main'],
		properties: [
			// Node properties
		],
	};

	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
		// Implementation
	}
}
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and meaningful commit messages:

* `Add: description` - New features
* `Fix: description` - Bug fixes
* `Update: description` - Updates to existing features
* `Refactor: description` - Code refactoring
* `Docs: description` - Documentation changes
* `Test: description` - Adding or updating tests

Examples:
```
Add: Support for product variant operations
Fix: Handle empty response from API gracefully
Update: Improve error messages for authentication failures
Docs: Add examples for customer management
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, test the following:

- [ ] All CRUD operations work for Products
- [ ] All CRUD operations work for Customers
- [ ] Order retrieval operations work
- [ ] Category listing works
- [ ] Credential validation works
- [ ] Error handling displays appropriate messages
- [ ] All optional parameters work as expected
- [ ] Node works in both manual and automated workflows

### Testing with Real API

Always test with a real FreeWebStore account:

1. Create a test store (use FreeWebStore's free tier)
2. Generate API credentials
3. Test all operations
4. Verify data integrity
5. Test error scenarios (invalid IDs, missing required fields, etc.)

## Documentation

### Updating Documentation

When adding new features, update:

1. **README.md** - Main documentation
2. **workflow-examples.md** - Add practical examples
3. **CHANGELOG.md** - Document the changes
4. **Code comments** - Add inline documentation

### Documentation Style

* Use clear, concise language
* Provide code examples
* Include expected input/output
* Explain why, not just what

## Release Process

Maintainers follow this process for releases:

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a git tag
4. Push to npm registry
5. Create GitHub release
